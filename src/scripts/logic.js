/*
  This file contains logic for parsing the data object received from BuiltWith.
  The purpose of this is to parse the object for complex technologies.
  If a url is found to have a highly complex site (particularly front-end wise), then certain responses are set.
  Below are the scores for how complex a site is that can be consumed by other functions.
  
  Scores:
  1 = Not very complex
  2 = Moderately complex
  3 = Highly complex, call your SE to strategize
